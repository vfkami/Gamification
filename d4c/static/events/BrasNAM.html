                This year, the VIII Brazilian Workshop on Social Network Analysis and Mining (BraSNAM 2019) will be held in conjunction with CSBC, providing a valuable opportunity for multidisciplinary groups to meet and engage in rich discussions about topics related to social network analysis. CSBC is the official event of the Brazilian Computing Society (SBC) and in its 39th edition, the conference will be held in the city of Belem, Para, Brazil.

                The study of social networks originated in social, educational and business communities, starting to have a theoretical support in 40’s. Currently, the increasing use of Web and social medium fosters interaction among people, data dissemination and information sharing. With this growing of available data – provided by people and their interaction, as also provided by logs and web servers – we have the opportunity of evaluate and develop techniques for social network analysis, identification and mining of social networks. This has led to a rising prominence of social network analyses in academia, politics, security, business, marketing, science and other fields.

                The BraSNAM 2019 provides an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from social network analysis and its related fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices.</li>
